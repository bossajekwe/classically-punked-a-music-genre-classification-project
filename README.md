# classically-punked-a-music-genre-classification-project

## Task
The task of this project was to extract features from 10 different genres of music and try to 
predict what type of genre it is.

## Description
To solve this problem I have used a collection of modules from Python which includes;
1. The `os module` for file handling of the audio files.
2. The `Librosa/matplotlib` module for extracting/plotting the features of an audio file.
3. The `numpy` module for mathematical operations on arrays.
4. The `JSON ` module for saving these features of audio files.
5. The `sci-kit` learn module for splitting the training and testing data.
6. The Tensorflow module for creating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Installation
This project does not need any form of installation, however, for this project the Librosa and Tensorflow
module must be installed. 

## Usage
This project has been implemented on google collab.
